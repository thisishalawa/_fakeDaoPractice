* Repository as a point of control
Repositories are classes which do all of the decision making regarding appâ€™s data.

*
* ,it does not make sense to have multiple repository objects, so it will be a singleton.
*  This time we need to pass in the FakeQuoteDao for repository to fulfill its role.
*  will use dependency injection to supply this FakeQuoteDao instance to the repository.

// FakeQuoteDao must be passed in - it is a dependency
//  could also instantiate the DAO right inside the class without all the fuss?
// Nope . This would break testability - you need to be able to pass a mock version of a DAO
// to the repository (e.g. one that upon calling getQuotes() returns a dummy list of quotes for testing)
// This is the core idea behind DEPENDENCY INJECTION - making things completely modular and independent.

    // This may seem redundant.
    // Imagine a code which also updates and checks the backend.
